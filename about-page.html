      <p class="paragraph1">
        Welcome to my website. I have created physical pieces of art for a
        number of years. My art reflects my exploration of science and nature,
        and my view from our place in space and time. We live on an exceptional
        planet. From earth we look out through time and view an ever-expanding
        universe, the outward view. We can also see into the subatomic universe,
        the inward view. We have reached a point in our evolution where we
        understand the connection between these seemingly different worlds.
        Where they intersect is what I consider the crossroad.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph2">
        As humans, we continue to develop science and spirituality based
        explanations for both of these views. The crossroad is a place where our
        ability to perceive and understand is quite remarkable. What we think we
        know blurs as we look farther from what we experience through our
        senses. These paintings explore the use of color and form at this
        crossroad of the exceptionally large and small. Thank you for visiting
        and I hope you enjoyed viewing my art.
